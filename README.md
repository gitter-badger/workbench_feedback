Deep Learning Workbench (DL Workbench) is an official UI environment of the OpenVINO™ toolkit.
The DL Workbench enables you to:

- Learn what neural networks are, how they work, and how to analyze their architectures and performance.
- Get familiar with the OpenVINO™ ecosystem and its main components without installing it on your system.
- Optimize your model and prepare it for deployment on the target system.
